    <p class='About'>
        I am a dedicated and passionate junior student at LNMIIT, Jaipur, anticipating a data scientist role and aimimg to put knowledge of Machine learning and deep learning which would faciliate the live of people for good.The project aims to create ML models to predict the ‘Chance of Admit’ with 
        minimum MSE and RMSE and maximum R-Square score by building the 
        following models: Multiple linear regressor (MLR), Random Forest Regressor 
        (RFR) , MLR with PCA and RFR with PCA. 
        In MLR, we used Backward elimination to remove those features that do not have 
        a significant effect on the dependent variable or prediction of output.
        Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used 
        for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning. It is a statistical process that 
        converts the observations of correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated 
        features with the help of orthogonal transformation. These new transformed 
        features are called the Principal Components. It is one of the popular tools that 
        is used for exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling. It is a technique to 
        draw strong patterns from the given dataset by reducing the variances.
        Finally, we plot a graph between actual and predicted value for all the four 
        models.Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to 
        the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and 
        Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble 
        learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a 
        complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.
        Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the 
        prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and 
        it predicts the final output. The greater number of trees in the forest leads to 
        higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfittingIn theory the PCA makes no difference, but in practice it improves rate of 
        training, simplifies the required neural structure to represent the data, and 
        results in systems that better characterize the "intermediate structure" of the 
        data instead of having to account for multiple scales - it is more accurate.
        From the above MLR and RFR model, we obtain the mean squared error of 
        MLR and RFR are, 0.005266386297364336 and 0.003102546549999995
        respectively. So, from the data, we conclude that, RFR model of the given 
        dataset give more optimized results than MLR model.
        Thus, from all four model, we can conclude that, RFR with PCA gives us 
        the most accurate results than any other model.
